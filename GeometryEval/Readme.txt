Description
This is an add-in that is intended to help illustrate the concept of a surface's parametric space.  It adds a new command to the INSPECT panel that when selected lets you choose any face and then the option of showing sketch lines drawn along the UV space to illustrate the parametric space of the surface or showing sketch lines drawn to illustrate normals on the surface.  A "Density" setting on the argument specifies the number of lines or normals to draw where they are evenly spaced in parametric space.
